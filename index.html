    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 26, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to SocialReach ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application, which helps marketing teams analyze influencer reach and assess whether influencers gain followers legitimately.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Data from Instagram:</strong> When you use our app, we access public data from Instagram, such as follower counts, posts, comments, likes, engagement rates, and other publicly available metrics. We do not access private profiles or restricted accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We collect usage statistics (e.g., app performance, feature usage) and device information (e.g., browser type) to improve our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>We only access publicly available data and do not store sensitive information such as Instagram login credentials.</em></p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To analyze influencer reach, engagement trends, and follower growth patterns.</li>
        <li>To detect suspicious activity (e.g., fake followers, bots) and assess the legitimacy of influencer audiences.</li>
        <li>To generate reports and insights for marketing teams to optimize influencer campaigns.</li>
        <li>To improve the accuracy and functionality of our app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share your information with third parties except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with trusted third-party services (e.g., hosting providers) that assist us in operating our app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>
    <p>We retain publicly available data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. Afterward, the data is deleted or anonymized.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may:</p>

        <li>Request corrections to inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data (subject to legal obligations).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users in the European Union and California have additional rights under GDPR and CCPA, respectively (see Section 9).</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be reflected on this page, and we will notify users via email or app notifications for significant updates.</p>
